# Agent Teams

Agent Teams let Claude Code spawn teammate agents that work in parallel, each in its own TUICommander terminal tab. Teammates share a task list, communicate directly with each other, and coordinate autonomously.

## How It Works

TUICommander automatically injects `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` into every PTY session. This unlocks Claude Code's `TeamCreate`, `TaskCreate`, and `SendMessage` tools. When Claude Code spawns a teammate, TUICommander creates a new terminal tab via its MCP `agent spawn` tool — no external dependencies required.

## Setup

No configuration needed. Agent Teams is enabled by default for all Claude Code sessions launched from TUICommander.

To verify it's active, check the environment inside any terminal:

```bash
echo $CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS
# Should print: 1
```

## Usage

Tell Claude Code to create a team using natural language:

```
Create an agent team with 3 teammates to review this PR:
- One focused on security
- One on performance
- One on test coverage
```

Claude Code handles team creation, task assignment, and coordination. Each teammate appears as a separate tab in TUICommander's sidebar.

### Navigating Teammates

Claude Code supports two display modes for teammates:

| Mode | How it works | Requirement |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **In-process** | All teammates run inside the lead's terminal. Use `Shift+Down` to cycle between them. | None |
| **Split panes** | Each teammate gets its own pane. | tmux or iTerm2 |

TUICommander works with both modes. In-process mode is the default and requires no extra setup. With split panes, each teammate appears as a separate TUICommander tab.

### Key Controls (In-process Mode)

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Shift+Down` | Cycle to next teammate |
| `Enter` | View a teammate's session |
| `Escape` | Interrupt a teammate's current turn |
| `Ctrl+T` | Toggle the shared task list |

### What Teams Can Do

- **Shared task list** — All teammates see task status and self-claim available work
- **Direct messaging** — Teammates message each other without going through the lead
- **Plan approval** — Require teammates to plan before implementing; the lead reviews and approves
- **Parallel work** — Each teammate has its own context window and works independently

## Good Use Cases

- **Code review** — Split review criteria across security, performance, and test coverage reviewers
- **Research** — Multiple teammates investigate different aspects of a problem simultaneously
- **Competing hypotheses** — Teammates test different debugging theories in parallel and challenge each other
- **New features** — Each teammate owns a separate module with no file conflicts

## Limitations

Agent Teams is an experimental Claude Code feature. Current limitations:

- **No session resumption** — `/resume` does not restore in-process teammates
- **One team per session** — Clean up before starting a new team
- **No nested teams** — Teammates cannot spawn their own teams
- **Token cost** — Each teammate is a separate Claude instance; costs scale linearly with team size
- **File conflicts** — Two teammates editing the same file leads to overwrites; assign distinct files to each

## Troubleshooting

**Teammates not appearing as tabs:**
- Verify the env var is set: `echo $CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` should print `1`
- Check that TUICommander's MCP server is running (status bar shows the MCP icon)

**Teammates not spawning at all:**
- Claude Code decides whether to create a team based on task complexity. Be explicit: "Create an agent team with N teammates"
- Check Claude Code version: Agent Teams requires a recent version

**Too many permission prompts:**
- Pre-approve common operations in Claude Code's permission settings before spawning teammates

## Deprecated: it2 Shim

Earlier versions of TUICommander used an `it2` shell script shim that emulated iTerm2's CLI to intercept teammate creation. This approach is deprecated — teammate spawning now uses direct MCP tool calls (`agent spawn`). The shim at `~/.tuicommander/bin/it2` is no longer needed.
