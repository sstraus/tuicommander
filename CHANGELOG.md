# Changelog

All notable changes to TUI Commander will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- **Tab scoping per worktree** - Each worktree/branch will have its own isolated set of tabs instead of sharing a global tab list

---

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-04

### Added
- Initial TUI Commander implementation
- **Multi-terminal support** - Up to 50 concurrent PTY sessions
- **Repository sidebar** - Hierarchical view of repositories with branches and worktrees
- **Tab bar** - Terminal tabs with keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+1-9)
- **Git worktree integration** - Create and manage git worktrees from the UI
- **Per-pane zoom** - Independent font size control per terminal (Cmd+Plus/Minus)
- **VS Code / Claude Code launchers** - Quick access buttons in status bar
- **Markdown preview panel** - Toggle with MD button
- **Diff preview panel** - Toggle with Diff button
- **Session persistence** - Terminals maintain state across tab switches

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: SolidJS + TypeScript + Vite
- **Backend**: Tauri (Rust) for native performance
- **Terminal**: xterm.js with WebGL renderer
- **State Management**: Custom stores (terminals, repositories)

### Known Issues
- Tabs from all worktrees visible when switching branches (fix planned)
