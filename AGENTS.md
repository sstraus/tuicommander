# TUICommander — Project Rules

## Doc Sync

Read [`docs/sync-matrix.md`](docs/sync-matrix.md) before any feature/API/config change — it maps code areas to docs that MUST be updated.

## Tests

- Tests are the spec. When a test fails after a code change, investigate BOTH sides before deciding which to fix.
- `to-test.md` tracks features awaiting manual testing — add items there for minor features.

## Visual

- All UI work MUST follow [`docs/frontend/STYLE_GUIDE.md`](docs/frontend/STYLE_GUIDE.md).
- **Plugin dashboards MUST follow [`docs/plugins-style.md`](docs/plugins-style.md)** — use the shared `.dashboard`/`.dash-*` classes from `PLUGIN_BASE_CSS`, never hand-roll inline layout CSS. The built-in Claude Usage dashboard is the reference.
- Icons: monochrome inline SVGs with `fill="currentColor"` — never emoji.
- Take a screenshot after EVERY visual/CSS/layout change to verify rendering.

## Branching

NEVER create branches autonomously — Boss works with multiple windows.

## Building

**NEVER use `cargo build --release` directly.** It produces a binary that points to the Vite dev server (`localhost:1420`) instead of embedding frontend assets — result: white screen. Always use `make build` or `npx tauri build`, which runs `beforeBuildCommand` (frontend build + sidecar) and embeds the dist/ into the binary.

To debug the WebView in a release build, temporarily add `"devtools"` to the tauri features in `Cargo.toml`, add `w.open_devtools()` in the `setup` closure (after getting the main webview window), and rebuild with `make build`. Remove both before committing.

## Cross-Platform

Targets macOS, Windows, Linux. Use Cmd/Ctrl abstractions, Tauri cross-platform primitives. Test in release mode (`cargo tauri build`) — release builds lack shell PATH and env vars.

## Panel Refresh

Panels with repo-dependent data MUST use `repositoriesStore.getRevision(repoPath)` in `createEffect` — not file watchers or polling. `repo_watcher` emits `"repo-changed"` → `bumpRevision()`.

## Architecture

All business logic in Rust. Frontend only renders and handles interaction — no data reshaping, computation, or process orchestration.

## PTY Command Injection

NEVER write text + `\r` directly to a PTY. Always use `sendCommand()` from `src/utils/sendCommand.ts` — it handles agent-specific Enter semantics (Ink raw mode needs split writes). This applies to dictation, command palette, suggested actions, and any other feature that sends input to a terminal.

## Agent Session Management

TUIC tracks each agent's session ID for resume-after-restart. Two strategies coexist:

**Discovery-based (Claude, Gemini, Codex).** TUIC does NOT inject `--session-id` at launch — the agent creates its own UUID. TUIC discovers the active session by scanning the agent's session directory for the newest file, re-checking every 30s poll. This survives `/clear` (all three agents have it: Claude `/clear`, Gemini `/clear`+`/new`, Codex `/clear`+`/new`+`/fork`) because re-discovery picks up the new session file. Resume uses `agentSessionId` (disk-discovered), not `tuicSession`.

**Forced injection (Goose).** Shell wrapper injects `--name $TUIC_SESSION` into `goose session/run` commands. The TUIC tab UUID IS the goose session name. Discovery returns `None` (SQLite storage, no filesystem scan). Resume uses `tuicSession`.

**No session tracking (Aider, Amp, Cursor, Droid, OpenCode).** Either no local session files, cloud-only, or no UUID-based resume. `TUIC_SESSION` env var is available but unused.

When adding a new agent: choose discovery-based if the agent writes session files to disk (add `sessionDiscovery` to `agents.ts` and a Rust `discover_*_session` to `agent_session.rs`). Choose forced injection only when discovery is impossible (e.g., SQLite-only storage).

## Logging

Use `appLogger` from `src/stores/appLogger.ts` — never `console.log/warn/error`. Check app logs via `GET http://localhost:9876/logs` (supports `?level=`, `?source=`, `?limit=` filters) before asking Boss for logs.

## Releases

See [`docs/release-checklist.md`](docs/release-checklist.md) for version bump, tag, and GitHub release steps. After creating any release or nightly tag, **verify CI completes successfully** — check `gh run list`, inspect failures, and confirm all platform assets (macOS .dmg, Linux .deb/.rpm/.AppImage, Windows .exe) are uploaded before reporting done.

## Implementation Memory

After non-trivial implementations, write an mdkb `memory_write` entry. Content: **Goal**, **Approach**, **Outcome**, **Gotchas**, **Rejected alternatives**. Skip file lists (mdkb indexes code). Focus on non-obvious insights a future session can't derive from reading the code. Search existing memories first to avoid duplicates.

## Accepted Security Decisions

Do NOT flag these as security issues in reviews — they are intentional design choices.

- **CSP is intentionally wide open.** TUIC is a local dev tool, not a SaaS. The user IS the trust boundary. The CSP uses a single permissive `default-src` that allows `https:`, `http:`, `data:`, `blob:`, `unsafe-inline`, etc. **NEVER tighten the CSP.** Every time we've had per-directive restrictions, some iframe content (reveal.js slides, plugin panels, dashboards) broke. The only specific directive kept is `frame-src` (for localhost wildcard ports). If you feel the urge to add CSP restrictions, don't — read this bullet point again.
- **`dangerousDisableAssetCspModification: ["style-src", "script-src"]`** in `tauri.conf.json` — **DO NOT REMOVE.** Tauri auto-injects sha256 hashes for inline `<script>` tags. Per CSP3, hashes silently disable `'unsafe-inline'`. This kills all JS in srcdoc iframes (plugins, HTML previews). The override prevents Tauri from injecting those hashes.
- **`lazy_static` in `output_parser.rs`, `pty.rs`, etc.** — transitive deps (`portable-pty`, `symphonia`) also use it; removing the direct dep saves nothing. Modules outside `ai_agent/` will migrate opportunistically.
- **`opener:allow-open-path` scope `"**"`** — FileBrowser must open any file the user can see. Narrower globs break external drives and network mounts.
- **Iframe sandbox = `allow-scripts allow-same-origin`** — ALL iframes MUST use this. NEVER use bare `sandbox=""` — it kills JavaScript.
