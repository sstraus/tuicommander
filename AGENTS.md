# TUICommander — Project Rules

## Doc Sync

Read [`docs/sync-matrix.md`](docs/sync-matrix.md) before any feature/API/config change — it maps code areas to docs that MUST be updated.

## Tests

- Tests are the spec. When a test fails after a code change, investigate BOTH sides before deciding which to fix.
- `to-test.md` tracks features awaiting manual testing — add items there for minor features.

## Visual

- All UI work MUST follow [`docs/frontend/STYLE_GUIDE.md`](docs/frontend/STYLE_GUIDE.md).
- **Plugin dashboards MUST follow [`docs/plugins-style.md`](docs/plugins-style.md)** — use the shared `.dashboard`/`.dash-*` classes from `PLUGIN_BASE_CSS`, never hand-roll inline layout CSS. The built-in Claude Usage dashboard is the reference.
- Icons: monochrome inline SVGs with `fill="currentColor"` — never emoji.
- Take a screenshot after EVERY visual/CSS/layout change to verify rendering.

## Branching

NEVER create branches autonomously — Boss works with multiple windows.

## Building

**NEVER use `cargo build --release` directly.** It produces a binary that points to the Vite dev server (`localhost:1420`) instead of embedding frontend assets — result: white screen. Always use `make build` or `npx tauri build`, which runs `beforeBuildCommand` (frontend build + sidecar) and embeds the dist/ into the binary.

To debug the WebView in a release build, temporarily add `"devtools"` to the tauri features in `Cargo.toml`, add `w.open_devtools()` in the `setup` closure (after getting the main webview window), and rebuild with `make build`. Remove both before committing.

## Cross-Platform

Targets macOS, Windows, Linux. Use Cmd/Ctrl abstractions, Tauri cross-platform primitives. Test in release mode (`cargo tauri build`) — release builds lack shell PATH and env vars.

## Panel Refresh

Panels with repo-dependent data MUST use `repositoriesStore.getRevision(repoPath)` in `createEffect` — not file watchers or polling. `repo_watcher` emits `"repo-changed"` → `bumpRevision()`.

## Architecture

All business logic in Rust. Frontend only renders and handles interaction — no data reshaping, computation, or process orchestration.

## PTY Command Injection

NEVER write text + `\r` directly to a PTY. Always use `sendCommand()` from `src/utils/sendCommand.ts` — it handles agent-specific Enter semantics (Ink raw mode needs split writes). This applies to dictation, command palette, suggested actions, and any other feature that sends input to a terminal.

## Logging

Use `appLogger` from `src/stores/appLogger.ts` — never `console.log/warn/error`. Check app logs via `GET http://localhost:9876/logs` (supports `?level=`, `?source=`, `?limit=` filters) before asking Boss for logs.

## Releases

See [`docs/release-checklist.md`](docs/release-checklist.md) for version bump, tag, and GitHub release steps.

## Implementation Memory

After non-trivial implementations, write an mdkb `memory_write` entry. Content: **Goal**, **Approach**, **Outcome**, **Gotchas**, **Rejected alternatives**. Skip file lists (mdkb indexes code). Focus on non-obvious insights a future session can't derive from reading the code. Search existing memories first to avoid duplicates.

## Ideas

See CLAUDE.md for ideas folder rules (gitignored).
