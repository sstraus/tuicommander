# Density modes for readability

## Problem Statement

TUI cannot control font size per-pane natively. Density modes (compact/normal/expanded) provide workaround for readability.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Three density modes: compact, normal, expanded
- [ ] Keyboard shortcut to cycle modes (Cmd+D)
- [ ] Persist density preference per-terminal
- [ ] Adjust content display based on mode

## Files

- src/main.ts
